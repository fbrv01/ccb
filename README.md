## **Cosma's Coloring Book**
It's my very first javascript project made from scratch.

The main idea is to develop a simple digital coloring book using React.

**Why SVG file over JPG?**

I've used Scalable Vector Graphics file created in GIMP because SVG has much more functionality over JPEG or PNG. SVGs are customizable via JS, scalable, are zoomable without loosing quality and appear high quality at any resolution.

To do:
 - [ ] styling
 - [ ] more images
 - [ ] responsiveness
